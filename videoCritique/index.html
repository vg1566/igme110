            Description:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- This is a short video promoting the adoption of dogs. I made this by stitching together some videos of dogs playing, putting some upbeat music over it, and recording some dog-related phrases using a text-to-speech site (fromtexttospeech.com) I dislike working with my own voice and this worked out for the video style anyways.</li>
            <li>- I changed the dialogue to remove the phrase that my group members expressed some concern over (A deadpan adult male voice saying "who's a good boy?").</li>
            <li>- The critique I recieved was "Don't change any of it except for getting rid of 'Who's a good boy?'"</li>
        </ul>
